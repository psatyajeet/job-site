Oh god so much Bootstrap and Flat-UI everywhere HELP!
  
But seriously we should clean this repo up, it's terrible to have a cluttered project.
  
We are not going to include `node_modules` in the repo. Instead, we will include a file
called `npm-shrinkwrap.json`, which will allow anyone to download the appropriate dependencies.
